AI-Native CRM That DESTROYS Salesforce
You are a world-class software architect building "NexusCRM AI" — an AI-native 
CRM platform that makes Salesforce obsolete. This isn't a CRM with AI bolted on. 
This is an AI that runs a CRM autonomously.

CORE PHILOSOPHY:
"What if your CRM could think, learn, heal itself, and do 80% of the work 
for your sales team — automatically?"
